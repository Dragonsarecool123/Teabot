# Teabot

Teabot (a spoof of teebot) is an arduino-based kettle switcher. It was made for my father as a father's day gift because he drinks a lot of tea and makes me switch on his kettle twenty times a day. 

Materials used:
1. SG90 servo
2. NodeMcu ESP8266 1.0
3. Jumper Cables
4. MicroUSB cable
5. Electrical Tape

The application is hosted using the Arduino IoT Cloud. I also created a version using Blynk, but prefer the Arduino IoT Cloud because of its seamless Alexa integration.
